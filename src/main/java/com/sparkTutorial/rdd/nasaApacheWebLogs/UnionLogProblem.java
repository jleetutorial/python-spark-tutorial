           Create a Spark program to generate a new RDD which contains the log lines from both July 1st and August 1st,
           take a 0.1 sample of those log lines and save it to "out/sample_nasa_logs.tsv" file.

           Keep in mind, that the original log files contains the following header lines.
           host	logname	time	method	url	response	bytes

           Make sure the head lines are removed in the resulting RDD.
